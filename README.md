![](https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/Voice_Module_ASR-TTS/blob/main/AI_Voice_Interaction_Module_Yahboom.jpg)
# Introduction
Yahboom intelligent voice interaction module that integrates voice recognition and voice broadcast. It adopts the CI1302 voice chip solution, built-in high-performance neural network processor, supports deep learning noise reduction and echo cancellation, and brings a smooth voice interaction experience. On board microphones and speakers, supports Chinese and English entries, and recognition rate of up to 99%. It can also customize the wake-up words, command words, playback timbre and volume, and recognition sensitivity and other parameters, making AI voice development simpler and smarter.
# Features
* Preset 110+ voice commands, support custom Chinese and English command words.

Users can modify the command words through the exclusive web page we provide, generate a new firmware file, and write the firmware to the module through PC software, the module will recognize new commands. Built-in storage space 2M, up to about 120 command words can be written.

* Embedded high-fidelity speakers and high-performance microphones.

Integrated with advanced algorithms and circuit noise reduction, it can effectively filter the background noise in the environment, and the recognition rate can reach 99% within a range of 5M, thereby achieving natural conversation and echo cancellation. It can provide clear sound quality output and accurately restore voice details.

* On board coprocessor and IIC/serial port/Type-C interface.

Integrates the STC8H chip, which can automatically convert voice data into serial port or IIC data format, simplifying the communication process with external master devices. Yahbom provides different connecting cables for free, and users can connect it with the MCU development board and embedded master control to achieve communication and create their own DIY projects.

* Provide usage tutorials based on a variety of development boards

Provide development board information such as STM32, ESP32, MSPM0, AR, Raspberry Pi, jetson series boards, RDK, etc. And provide SDK files for ROS1 and ROS2 systems.
